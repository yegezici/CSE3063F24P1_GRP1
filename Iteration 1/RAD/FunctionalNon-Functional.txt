Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements
Functional Requirements
User Login (Authentication)
The system should allow users (students, advisors, and department schedulers) to log in with their username and password.
Course Registration
Students should be able to register for courses in accordance with department rules.
Prerequisite courses should be checked and rules should be applied during registration.
Conflict and Capacity Management
The system should check time conflicts and capacity limits of courses.
When capacity is full, students should be added to the waiting list and notified if there is a vacancy.
Data Persistence
Data should be stored in JSON files; optionally, it should be supported by a database such as SQLite in the next stage.

Non-Functional Requirements
Usability
It should clearly notify the user of errors and provide correction opportunities.
Performance
It should be ensured that users log in and course registration processes are carried out quickly and without interruption.
Condition and capacity checks should be made in real time during course registration.
Security
User login information should be encrypted and stored securely.
Variables should not be randomly changed.
Protection should be provided against operations that the user does not have authorization in the system.
Scalability
The system should be expandable for new user roles (Department Head, Admin, Student Affairs) that may be added in the future.
It should be able to respond to the increase in the number of users or the need to store more data.
Ease of Maintenance
The code should be highly modular and the responsibilities of each class should be clearly defined.
Portability
The system should be able to run in a platform-independent environment such as a command-line interface or Python.
It should be possible to transfer Java code to Python without any problems (Iteration 3).
Reliability and Accuracy
The system is expected to maintain accuracy in student registration data and reliably perform conflict and capacity checking during course registration.
